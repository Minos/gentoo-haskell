		Provides clonesim, a clone simulator that simulates shotgun
		genomic clones, and flowsim, that takes the output from clonesim
		(or any other Fasta-formatted file) and generates simulated
		reads from them mimicing Roche&#39;s 454 pyrosequencing technology,
		writing output in 454&#39;s native SFF format.  The flowgram
		generation is based on empirical distributions derived from real
		data (although analytic distributions are available too, if you
		prefer).
		
		The Darcs repository is at &lt;http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/flowsim&gt;.
