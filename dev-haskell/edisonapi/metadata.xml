		Edison is a library of purely functional data structures written by
		Chris Okasaki.  It is named after Thomas Alva Edison and for the
		mnemonic value EDiSon (Efficent Data Structures).
		Edison provides several families of abstractions, each with
		multiple implementations.  The main abstractions provided by Edison are:
		Sequences such as stacks, queues, and dequeues;
		Collections such as sets, bags and heaps; and
		Associative Collections such as finite maps and priority queues
		where the priority and element are distinct.
