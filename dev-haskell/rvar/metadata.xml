		Random number generation based on modeling random
		variables by an abstract type (&#39;RVar&#39;) which can be
		composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
		either monadic or \&quot;pure\&quot; styles.
		
		The primary purpose of this library is to support
		defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
		random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
		but performance is an important goal too.
		
		In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
		comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
		a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
		the same algorithms.
		
		Changes in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers
		dependency.
